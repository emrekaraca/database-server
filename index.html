      <strong>Database server</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on <code>http://localhost:4000/</code>.  When your server receives a request on <code>http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue</code> it should store the passed key and value in memory.  When it receives a request on <code>http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey</code> it should return the value stored at <code>somekey</code>.</p>
    <p>During your interview, you will pair on saving the data to a file.  You can start with simply appending each write to the file, and work on making it more efficient if you have time.</p>
